# 发布与管理模块 / Publishing and Management Module / PMM

- The goal of the module is to allow users to package, distribute, upgrade, and monitor the performance and stability of applications. This includes automated builds, continuous integration, version control, performance monitoring, and backups.
- The goal of this phase is to build the framework of this module to enable user-configurable build tasks:
  - Users are able to configure Jenkins build tasks to specify how to build the application.
  - After a code change, Jenkins automatically triggers the build task, retrieves the source code, executes the build, and generates an executable file or package for the application.

It's the seventh module of the LCSP.
